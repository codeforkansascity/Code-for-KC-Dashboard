# Code-for-KC-Dashboard
We are building a tool that allow users to collect, search, and view project information and member information within Code for KC (such as automated attendance tracking, searching for members by skill, automated project status updates.)

We recently obtained a sandbox instance of Code for Philly's tool, laddr (https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/laddr/blob/develop/README.md) and are testing to see if it can be adapted/updated for use by our brigade.
